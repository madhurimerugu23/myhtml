        <p>Node is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables the execution of code on the server side. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling the development of scalable and efficient network applications.</p>
    <p>Node is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling the development of scalable and efficient network applications. Known for its event-driven architecture, Node is widely used for building fast, lightweight, and highly responsive server-side applications.</p>
    <h3>How Node.js works:</h3>
    <p>How Node.JS Works?
        Node.js accepts the request from the clients and sends the response, while working with the request node.js handles them with a single thread. To operate I/O operations or requests node.js use the concept of threads. Thread is a sequence of instructions that the server needs to perform. It runs parallel on the server to provide the information to multiple clients. Node.js is an event loop single-threaded language. It can handle concurrent requests with a single thread without blocking it for one request.</p>
   <h3>Applications of Node.js</h3>
   <p>Node.js is suitable for various applications, including:

    Real-time chats<br>
    Complex single-page applications<br>
    Real-time collaboration tools<br>
    Streaming apps<br>
    JSON APIs</p><h3>Advantages of Node:</h3>
        <p>Node is a open source platform and fast execution process.
        Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing for efficient handling of multiple requests simultaneously.
        It has a rich ecosystem that provides various node package manger (npm).
        It supports asynchronous programming, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.
        Relatively easy for developers already familiar with JavaScript.</p>
