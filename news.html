            <h2>stop treating education as a bussiness</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Education advocates are calling for an end to the commercialization
                 of education, arguing that it undermines the true purpose of learning. </p>
                 <h4>The Growing Commercialization of Education</h4><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the landscape of education has undergone a profound shift, with increasing emphasis on commercialization. Private institutions, tuition centers, and even some public schools have begun to operate more like businesses, focusing on profitability rather than the fundamental mission of education: to nurture minds, foster creativity, and prepare individuals to contribute meaningfully to society. This trend has sparked widespread concern among educators, policymakers, and parents alike</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trend disproportionately affects
                 marginalized communities, deepening 
                inequalities. Advocates emphasize that education should
                 prioritize students' holistic development rather than financial gain.
                  They urge policymakers to refocus on making education a public good, accessible to all, 
                  and free from corporate 
                  influence.</p></p>

                              <p>Telangana is experiencing a significant rise in seasonal diseases, including dengue, malaria, and viral fevers, according to health experts.
                                 The surge is attributed to the ongoing monsoon season, which has created favorable conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes and the spread of infections.
                                  Hospitals across the state are reporting an increase in patient admissions, particularly among children and the elderly. Health authorities are urging residents to take preventive measures, such as using mosquito nets and maintaining hygiene, to curb the spread of these diseases. The public is also advised to seek medical attention promptly if symptoms arise. </p>

                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India is grappling with a rising unemployment rate, with millions of job seekers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing economy. Recent data shows a worrying trend, particularly among the youth, where joblessness has reached alarming levels. Experts attribute this to various factors, including slow economic growth, automation, and a lack of job creation in key sectors. The informal sector, which employs a significant portion of the population, has also been hit hard, exacerbating the situation. The government has introduced several initiatives to boost employment, but challenges remain. Economists are calling for urgent and sustained efforts to address this crisis, emphasizing the need for skil
                        l development and investment in emerging industries to create new opportunities
